This progam was written repurposing code from 
the following github repository:

https://github.com/Armandosauce/Unity-2017-Game-AI-Programming-Third-Edition

The scene FlockingReynold.unity has been edited to 
adhere to the following rules:

The three modes are described here:

(Default Mode) Follow the Leader, the flocking AI controller will follow a 
clearly marked target. Extra credit will be given for a user 
controlled character that the flock may follow.
 
Lazy Flight , the flocking AI will choose a random point 
to fly towards within your scene. When the destination 
is reached, a new target within the limits of the scene is 
chosen and the flock flies towards that.

 
Circle a Tree, the flocking AI controller will follow a 
pre-specified set of waypoints to flock to. The set of 
waypoints may be thought of as some closed shape such as a 
figure eight or a circle.
